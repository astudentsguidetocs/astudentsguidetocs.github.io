# Design Patterns

Design patterns might seem like a weird thing to put in a book
with so much soft skill and people-based advice. I agree! But if you're
just starting out in computer science, I think it's helpful to know
that these things exist and are out there (and are made to help you and your team!).

[Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru) is a wonderful resource with both
free and paid resources that can help you learn more about design patterns (and
refactoring, which is another great skill to have).

Design patterns are great because they can improve our ability to maintain
code, explain it, and understand it. It might be a little more advanced, so
don't worry about learning them at the introductory level, but as you get more
intermediate and advanced in the field, give them a try.

Most languages also have books like [Effective Java](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0134685997)
which explain patterns, paradigms, and other useful things that help you get to that
next level of understanding [^ref1].

<!-- describe MVC architecture/pattern? and maybe builder pattern as an example? -->

[^ref1]: I asked for this book for my birthday one time. My parents were slightly confused 
and perhaps a twinge disappointed. :)
