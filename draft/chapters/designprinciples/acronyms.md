*There Are So Many Acronyms In Computer Science*


<!-- The art of computer science is being able to guess
the acronym of whatever obscure thing you're using. -->

<!-- I considered looking through all of my college notes
and making a book of every acronym I've ever seen in CS,
and then realized that I value my sanity. However, if someone
wants to do this, let me know. -->
