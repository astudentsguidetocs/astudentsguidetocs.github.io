# Self care

..is something that is way too often neglected by folks in our profession.
The amount of times I've heard things along the lines of "I am mentally unwell"
or morbid jokes about mental health at Mines is astounding. I think people push 
themselves so hard to reach a certain GPA and appease others, make a startup to
make a living, et cetera et cetera - to the point where they forget to care
for themselves.

Self care can look like many different things: perhaps it's sleeping in a half
an hour (or sleeping at all, true story!), getting a good meal, going for a walk,
or anything that helps **you** feel good. (We just had a section on saying no - and for the record, I would classify saying no to things and building boundaries as self care!)
I am by no means a health expert, but I feel like this is important to bring up because, as mentioned, it often gets neglected or brushed aside.

## Caring for others

Definitely care about yourself and treat yourself with kindness, but once you
have stable foundations, it's great to care about others too.

It is **never** a bad idea to check in with somebody. I don't think there's been
one time where I've checked in with a friend and they haven't been at least kind or
respectful, if not grateful about it.

Through college, I think there were at least three instances where I had friends 
dealing with serious mental health issues [^ref1], and I felt so unprepared. But
the fact that you can simply be there for someone will help them more than you
can ever imagine (which I have been told by people I've helped). Show **compassion**
to them: imagine what you would need if you were in their situation. Be present
and attentive with them.

## Mindfulness

The greatest act of self care I do on a regular basis is mindfulness meditations.
Hear me out -- I'm not trying to become a monk or sound "new-agey" nor do I sit in rooms humming
like meditation is portrayed in the movies.

Mindfulness is all about noticing your thoughts and feelings **in the present moment**
and questioning and observing the world thoughtfully. I'm not sure I could teach it to
you in a couple paragraphs; check out Healthy Minds below for what I think is the best
program to learn.

Mindfulness is rooted in [neuroplasticity](https://mcpress.mayoclinic.org/healthy-aging/the-power-of-neuroplasticity-how-your-brain-adapts-and-grows-as-you-age/), the brain's ability to 
change over time. You can re-wire your brain to notice when you're getting carried away or
when you're acting on impulses and urges when you don't want to be. It's like your brain
is a muscle that you can train to be more mindful of the world around you.

Mindfulness meditation changed my life. I don't worry about the future or past as much as
I did, I feel like I'm a better listener, and I feel like I can be so much more compassionate
and understanding of others. (And much, much more.) As an aside, I don't want to make it sound
like some magic pill that will cure you of all ailments. Often, I feel like doing it with that
motive degrades your experience as it's more about how you *actually* feel. I just view the
benefits as a positive side effect from mindful introspection.

I believe so much in meditation and mindfulness that I would like to offer up a few
options that you could literally start in the next five minutes; all great options that I have either personally used or know people who do [^ref4]:
- [Healthy Minds](https://www.portal.hminnovations.org/launch) - free, out of a lab
in Madison, WI called the [Center for Healthy Minds](https://centerhealthyminds.org), with
some practices inspired by Tibetian Buddhism [^ref2]. I've been using this app for about
two years and I think it's the best one; it also talks about the science behind the meditations
they're teaching you, which is great for us systematic engineers. [^ref3].
- [Smiling Mind](https://www.smilingmind.com.au/smiling-mind-app) - the first meditation app I used. It's out of Australia, but as long as you don't mind an Australian accent (I actually found it *helped* me listen and focus in guided meditation) it's great!
- [Calm](https://www.calm.com/ua-homepage-v2?pid=googleadwords_int&af_channel=googlesem&af_c_id=14668023573&af_adset_id=170649968373&af_ad_id=722102865780&af_siteid=g&af_sub_siteid=&af_keyword=kwd-316578326783&af_sub3=c&af_sub4=CjwKCAiApY-7BhBjEiwAQMrrEcGRuemNJ28f5vczrcs2GlbwG3K5QbFtMWoFD3yycZonA-NV206SvhoCi4IQAvD_BwE&utm_medium=paid&utm_source=googlesem&utm_campaign=14668023573&utm_content=ua-homepage-v2&utm_term=kwd-316578326783&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAAC6g0qel-tdYLcxY6_Kw4py3P6WU1&gclid=CjwKCAiApY-7BhBjEiwAQMrrEcGRuemNJ28f5vczrcs2GlbwG3K5QbFtMWoFD3yycZonA-NV206SvhoCi4IQAvD_BwE) - paid, but I've heard great things about it.
- [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/?gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAADLlnJ2GwRdgwFeJ_qsKgrlOENd8L&gclid=CjwKCAiApY-7BhBjEiwAQMrrEZBOVDLg7CbwMPeqHh2nzkYgNU8jh0TcmEMumlATH46iZBe93Pz1wxoC99QQAvD_BwE) - paid, but I think the most popular option nowadays along with Calm. One of my friends really enjoys this one, especially for sleep.


[^ref1]: If you're feeling mentally unwell or are in a crisis, call 911 and **talk
to a trusted person if you feel up to it**.

[^ref2]: They don't "force it" upon you or anything, nor am I advertising this in
any endorsement of religion. It's just interesting to hear what actual trained monks
do and how even they deal with anxiety in their lives.

[^ref3]: I'm really passionate about meditation, mindfulness, and the science behind it,
as it has brought me so much calm and clarity in my life. Feel free to bring it up with me,
I love to talk about it.

[^ref4]: I receive no payment from any of these. I am just spreading the word.
