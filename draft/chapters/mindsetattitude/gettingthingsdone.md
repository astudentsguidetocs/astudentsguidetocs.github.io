# Getting things done

<!-- dont enter the productivity trap; buying things and getting nothing done; but dont get nothing done either;
self improvement trap implies you're not valuing yourself already. value yourself and then make changes from there. -->

<!-- the productivity trap: you dont have to (and literally cant) be productive 100% of the time, you're human.
sure, if you're pushing toward something great you make sacrifices, but otherwise, say no (the next section).--> 

<!-- GTD book by david allen -->

<!-- nothing changes if nothing changes; if you always do what you always did, you'll always get what you always got. no matter what it is. -->

<!-- know yourself and try things out -->

<!-- trust in systems -->

<!-- free or not - obsidian, notes, reminders, paper -->

<!-- planning is time well spent; take 1-3 hours every weekend to reorganize
your priorities; or spend 5 minutes every night before you go to sleep reorganizing. 
just don't make it procrastination -->

<!-- short term todo, long term projects, would be nice but backburner; project ideas doc -->


<!-- GTD: minimize your distractions, but grouping them is fine; learn how much time it takes you to do this or know innately; Poojaâ€™s schedule tips w/ calendar -->
