# Getting things done

<!-- dont enter the productivity trap; buying things and getting nothing done; but dont get nothing done either;
self improvement trap implies you're not valuing yourself already. value yourself and then make changes from there. -->

<!-- GTD book by david allen -->

<!-- nothing changes if nothing changes; if you always do what you always did, you'll always get what you always got. no matter what it is. -->

<!-- know yourself and try things out -->

<!-- trust in systems -->

<!-- free or not - obsidian, notes, reminders, paper -->

<!-- planning is time well spent; take 1-3 hours every weekend to reorganize
your priorities; or spend 5 minutes every night before you go to sleep reorganizing. 
just don't make it procrastination -->

<!-- short term todo, long term projects, would be nice but backburner; project ideas doc -->
