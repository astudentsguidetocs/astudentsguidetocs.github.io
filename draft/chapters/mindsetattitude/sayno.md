# Saying No

The best advice I ever got from my research advisor
was not how to code Python better, communicate with people,
write scientific papers, do research, or anything like that;
it was a small snippet of advice geared at managing your life:
saying no.

His analogy goes as follows: work is like a gas. If you just
try to run around waving it toward some direction, or trying
to contain it from spreading, it's going to do nothing. More of
it is going to keep finding you, too, if you don't set boundaries.
You have to **build walls** in your life to stop it from spreading [^ref1].

This advice is worth spending an entire section on because
it's genuinely lifechanging.

## Stressculture

I always thought I needed to prove myself to everybody. Part of
it was personal, but part of it was because I felt threatened or afraid
of the culture. I never thought I would succeed unless I worked harder
than absolutely everybody all of the time. Unfortunately, these sentiments
seem pretty common in today's age, and almost exemplify the American dream
of becoming rich and wealthy if you just work harder than everybody always.

[^ref1]: Maybe this is where the analogy breaks down, but imagine
we need to build some uber-pressurized walls that won't leak out the gas.
