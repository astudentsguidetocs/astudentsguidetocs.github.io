# Women in CS

I can tell you nothing more important in this chapter
than **simply listening**, but I will attempt to elaborate.
The following are some assorted points I've learned from
women in CS over the years, again by truly *listening*
and empathizing with the other person.

For far too long, women in CS have been harrassed and
at both spoken and unspoken disadvantages in the field.
Demographics make things especially hard, when most women
in CS will be surrounded by a male majority most of the time.

I would like to think that I've always respected women in CS,
but I begun to really care even more after reading the book
[Brotopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotopia) \[[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Brotopia-Breaking-Boys-Silicon-Valley/dp/0735213534)] which I
would wholeheartedly recommend for **every** man in CS (women, too,
although you may unfortunately be familiar with what's discussed.
Explained more below.)

Before I begin: I hope none of this comes across as patronizing nor
am I saying I am free of all mistakes. I am merely trying to be an
ally and spread the word to male audiences.

**Sweat the small stuff**: I've spoken to ex-Silicon Valley women and
a plethora of female students in CS (at least, as far as that goes with [Mines' demographics](https://www.mines.edu/diversity/annual-report-2021/recruitment/)) and they all seem to agree:
**the small things** are what drains you down over the days, weeks, months, and years.

For instance, it's getting asked out for the *fourth time* [^ref1], or hit on in academic or
work settings where you're just trying to focus (and where that would be inappropriate, 
obviously), that seems to tire women in CS out more than anything.

In *Brotopia*, Emily Chang describes real Silicon Valley scenarios which sound like they're 
straight from [The Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)) (e.g.
hitting on people, making inappropriate jokes, et cetera). After reading that, I texted a friend 
in CS, and said "no way this happens!" while describing the chapters. She said that it was normal.
Every time I read something, I was more and more enlightened to every little thing women in CS must 
go through on a regular basis. I kept on texting my friend. She was continuously unsurprised.

**Sexual harrassment and discrimination is real, call it out**: Again, especially in
Silicon Valley (if *Brotopia* is to be believed, which it should be), this is rampant.
Most people don't report these types of things, either out of fear, unwillingness,
or even the fact that they're used to it.

One of my now-graduated friends said her research advisor wouldn't trust her with
tasks and would give her menial tasks if anything, while favoring the other men on
the team. I told her to report it, and she said it would be over soon enough so she didn't.

Definitely don't be the person harrassing or discriminating, but beyond that, help
to make a more safe space for women in CS. Imagine if you were barred from a job or
research opportunity merely because of your gender (or any other quality about you).

I think the people who do these awful things are more hidden nowadays and usually
test the waters with you, saying borderline rude things first to see if you're "with it."
Unrelated to gender, I had a former coworker drop a few "jokes" that were borderline 
Nazi-esque and homophobic. I told him to stop and didn't associate myself with him anymore
(I *should have* additionally said something to HR, but thought the shunning would be fine).

**Call people out** if they're saying bad things. You don't want to work for or with those people.

**Actually listen**: I've been in group projects with a male-majority where the female in
the group gets completely ignored. People didn't even acknowledge her. My best strength
was telling group members **no**, listen to her. One time we had spent upwards of 12 hours 
banging our head on desks over a project and *she* held the last few answers but the group didn't 
believe her. I told them to listen, and we finally and swiftly finished once the group actually listened.

**Intentions are pretty clear**: In line with women constantly being asked out and hit on
in these environments, women can see your intentions pretty quickly. And, the sad thing is,
often times having a partner doesn't even stop men in CS. One of my friends says she has
referenced her partner of *many* years to a guy who was hitting on her, and he keeps on
following her around and dropping hints that she looks nice. **Don't be that guy**.

**Don't stare**: I can't believe I'm giving this advice to a primarily adult audience,
but don't stare. You know what I mean. I once even had a friend say she was considering
dressing more like guys. That's *heartbreaking*.


[^ref1]: I have genuinely heard of women who have been asked out *at least*
four times a term. Do you understand how exhausting that must be?
