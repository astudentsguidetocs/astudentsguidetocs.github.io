# Difficult people

Bad news: There will **always** be difficult people to deal with, or difficult
situations with those people. In some respects, I'm probably a difficult person to work with.



## In their shoes

Remember the classic kindergarten proverb: **put yourself in someone else's shoes**.

Along these lines, I mentioned in a previous section that I do mindfulness meditations a lot.
One insightful idea from a guided meditation I listened to is reflecting on
the following questions when you just *can't* understand the other person's perspective:
- What am I missing?
- Can you believe that this person wants happiness & to be free of suffering just as much
as you do?

Often, I find that these two questions alone can lead to a helpful resolution. Because, if
you feel so strongly about one thing that you **can't** see any other perspective, **chances
are that you're missing something**.

This isn't to say you can't or won't be annoyed by people on a daily basis. Maybe
somebody cuts you off in traffic - that's irritating. But flip the script before
you honk at them: maybe they're late for work. Maybe they're nervous merging into
the lane because they just started driving. Maybe they've got a kid in the back
who they're also trying to keep an eye on. I'm not justifying poor driving, but I am
justifying the need for patience and respect with others. It will go a long way.
