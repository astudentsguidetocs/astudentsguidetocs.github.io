# Working in teams

Working in teams is a lifelong skill that I don't think anyone
is perfect at. But there are many things that can help you get better.
And, often times, especially in software engineering, we idolize that
genius founder (Mark Zuckerberg) who seemingly singlehandedly changes
the world. But, when it comes down to it, humans are better working together:
we can achieve more and do more.

## Know when to step up (and down)


## Know your team, know your people


## Communicate, communicate, communicate

<!-- communicate your feelings, your vision for the product, your work -->
