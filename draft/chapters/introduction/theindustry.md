I thought it might be useful to answer just a few more questions about the CS
industry as a whole:
- Why do we even go to college for CS?
- What are the implications of AI?
- How and why does the industry move so quickly? 
- Why do we get paid as much as we do?

## Why college?

## Moving quickly

## AI Implications

## Getting paid
