# The building blocks

Remember when you learned your ABCs as a kid? ..when 
you learned how to write and how to read? Okay, probably
not honestly, but there are similar foundations for working in CS.

Before you do anything else, I think you should have these
basics down; they will *really* help in the long run!

## Typing + Keybinds

It sounds basic, but I think people often underestimate how
typing and keybinds can help productivity so much. Sometimes 
CS people are astonished by my typing speed [^ref], but you 
don't have to have a fancy $200 keyboard with decked out 
keycaps or even a duck keyboard [^ref2] to type quick; just
get quick with typing on whatever keyboard you have and it
will translate.

Keybinds are also important; learn those [vim shortcuts](https://devhints.io/vim),
or even the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings)/specific IDE ones. 
It makes you so much quicker if you just invest a bit of time to learn.

If I really tried, I could probably not use a mouse for a few hours
while coding. I know people who *intentionally* do that, and do it well.

## Git

I've helped undergraduate & graduate students, professionals at
jobs, and maybe even a couple of professors with Git before. I can't
stress enough how vital this skill is to have; you can learn any programming
language and people will forgive you, but if you roll up to a job not knowing
Git either, I think that might be frustrating to your coworkers.

## Personal Computers

A computer scientist needs a computer? What? No, but I know
a ton of computer science majors who are either really frustrated
with their current computer (whether laptop or desktop) situation. I 
don't want to come across as insensitive to different financial
situations as laptops are *not* cheap [^ref3], but once you feel financially
comfortable, it wouldn't be a bad idea to set yourself up for success.
After all, you're going to spend a lot, like, a *lot* of time with
your computer; you might as well enjoy it!

## The internet is your oyster

The internet is there to help as your right-hand man/woman/toolbox of
many answers; whether it's StackOverflow, Google, ChatGPT, GitHub, Geeks4Geeks,
language docs, or otherwise, if you can admit you need help and go and find some,
it goes a long way. When I was first learning to code, I felt bad or dishonest
looking things up as it felt like cheating and I knew it would harm my learning.
There's a balance to be found here: give whatever problem you're working on an
honest attempt *first*, and then if you're still stuck after trying a couple of things
and (hopefully) asking a coworker or friend, hop on over to the internet.


[^ref]: Usually like 80-90 WPM on a good day, 100+ if I'm really sweating to show off ;)

[^ref2]: I have a keyboard with about a hundred ducks over all of the keycaps. Yes, really.

[^ref3]: Especially not a Mac, but I am always encouraging Mac over Windows, especially because you
get that builtin UNIX terminal so you don't have to deal with PowerShell shenanigans.
