# Integrating new people

Integrating new people into teams always brings with it struggles:
for both the team and the new people involved. I think sometimes
not enough emphasis is put on integrating new people, which can
make them lose interest in your work. 

I've seen this in my experiences managing both officers and members
of Mines ACM, and in our OreCart app. But also just at a level of
being integrated into teams myself. If you're a human being, at some
point you were integrated into a team or group. What made you stay
and/or what made you leave? What made you feel valued? These are
important things to reflect on when you have your own teams.

The best way I saw at ACM to integrate new people into a community [^ref1]
was to simply **go and talk with people** and **break down the twos**:
most people would come to the club with someone they knew, and then
awkwardly just sit in the back eating pizza and not interacting
with anyone but themselves.

I saw this as an opportunity: I would go up to them
and talk to them. I'd ask what's going on in their classes and why
they were interested in ACM. Or, if that wasn't the right vibe, I 
would **act silly**. I'm not saying this in a manipulative
way, but typically, cracking some awful jokes makes you seem a
lot more human to others. There's obviously a balance so that you don't
lose all of your credibility, but if you can make the newcomer smile,
they'll remember you. And if you can **remember their name**, they'll
make an effort to get to know you and remember yours too [^ref2].

In the OreCart app development, we were always looking for more hands 
on deck [^ref3]. Finding interested people was hard enough, but then when
we got them into our meetings, it was really difficult to get them truly
involved in the product and the development process. I'm not saying I was perfect 
or successful by any means. I've just learned from my mistakes.

One mistake I made was assigning busywork. It's pretty easy for someone to sniff
out that they're doing irrelevant things. We thought it was necessary to get
them in with the codebase, but ultimately their interest would fizzle out and
we wouldn't bother because we had bigger fish to fry. If I could do it again, I
would get them involved closer to the heart of the product and have someone mentor
them more closely.

Another mistake was not communicating well. I think our "core team" communicated
very well and I'm proud of that, but our newcomers were an afterthought. None
of us had enough time to mentor [^ref4] and so we couldn't give the newcomers
the time of day and the support that they needed. **Invest**, literally and
metaphorically, into your newcomers. They're the future of the product
and your teams.

Even if your team doesn't communicate well, **be the glue** that sticks
everything together. People can come to you and you can redirect what
they have to say to the right person that needs to hear it. Often,
I think this is my best skill on a team: it's balancing two (or more)
fires and holding everything together, like that [scene in Captain America: Civil War](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ccey7IJLCM) 
[^ref5]. It's the ability to clarify things between everybody and
make everyone around you more productive and successful.


[^ref1]: Building a community is a whole different skillset: it takes a
**lot** of work and is a fragile organism; one step wrong or one person
removed and the community starts to break down.

[^ref2]: People who know me closely know that I'm scarily good at names.
I've had professors, TAs, and friends alike ask me for people's names so
that they can go talk to them. I'm not even sure why, it just comes naturally 
to me. You don't have to be the same, but find a way that works for you:
**trust me**, it pays off. Some of my best friendships have come from simply
just remembering a name and remembering a thing or two about the person.

[^ref3]: Not enough help was probably the reason the project failed in the
end, but then again, it's hard to convince people to work for free, and we
had no funding.

[^ref4]: See chapter: *Saying no*

[^ref5]: Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, I compare myself
to a superhero with superhuman strength. Definitely not my intention, but it's
just an analogy: you're Captain America, and you've got one person (the helicopter)
and another person (the platform) to hang onto.
