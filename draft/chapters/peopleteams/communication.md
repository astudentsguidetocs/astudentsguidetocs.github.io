# Communication

**Communication is all about getting the point across effectively and
understandably**. What makes communication effective and understandable?
It's clear, concise, and moves toward a result.

Communication is as much about listening as it is speaking. If you
can't ever hear the other person talking and genuinely process what
they're telling you, nobody is making any progress.

Communication comes in different shapes and sizes: a hallway chat,
a presentation, a meeting, an email, a text, a book, et cetera et cetera.

Both in verbal and written communication, you should **hear yourself speak**.
Can you actually hear and understand what you're saying as you're saying it,
or are you just going on and on? If the latter, the person listening to you will
probably think the same thing.

## Know your audience

Knowing your audience is vital to any sort of communication. Especially in
the engineering sense, does your audience literally understand what you're saying?
Or are they missing the prerequisite knowledge to understand?

Another aspect is professionalism and formality. A bit of good old fashioned
professionalism doesn't hurt, and is totally necessary if you're working with
customers, clients or stakeholders. Formality also: if you're working with someone
superior to you, you can show them some respect. But if they're informal with you,
you can be with them too. Meet them where they're at and both parties will hear
each other a little better.

## Cut to the chase

This is something I've worked on in my communication for years. I always
feel like there is *always* more to say, and anything left unsaid is a loss.
But this creates one-sided conversation where it's me speaking *at* somebody,
not with them.

**Less is more**, and **silence is ok**. People process very differently, both
in style and in speed. If you're neck deep into an explanation and you're getting
blank stares, slow down. See if you can boil your explanation down to just a few
key ideas, and then if your audience wants more details, they will ask for it.

<!-- less is more: even if something is super complicated, saying
stuff for the sake of sounding smart or using big words is pointless. -->

It's fine to be silent for a few seconds too. This gives more time for you to think
about what you're going to say, and for your audience to process what you're saying.

## Emails

One example of communication we see abundantly in our lives is, of course,
email. (Also texts, but people never put as much stock into those.)

People often freak out about writing emails or put way too much stock into
them (or both). I definitely still do this sometimes. The key is to limit
how much you're looking at that email draft. There will always be something
more you can fix or change. And once you send the email off, you'll notice
something that was maybe slightly wrong anyways. So there's no need to deliberate.

**Give yourself 3 attempts**: One to write the email just by "winging it." Next,
you should review it for any structural or grammar issues. Finally, review it one
more time to see if there's anything you could remove to be more concise and clear.
Maybe review it for grammar issues one last time after that. And then convince
yourself that it's good before you drain more time tweaking it into oblivion.

Fundamentally, emails are sent back and forth because **someone needs something**.
They need you to do something for them. They need to do something for you.
They need your attention. Whatever it is, both parties want to get down to business.

If you send over **four** emails back and forth, it's probably time to refocus because
something is getting lost. Change the subject line. Start a new thread. Schedule a call
or an in person meeting. Or even send them a text or Teams message. Either way, don't
make a giant thread that keeps on growing with more people.

Again, know your audience. If it's a CEO, department head, or someone who you
respect, maybe you can spend a bit more time editing. Your email should be more
formal as well. If it's a coworker, you can be less formal because they probably
just want you to cut to the chase. I think it's also a bit silly if you're super
formal over email but then casual in person. Emails should genuinely reflect you
and what you're trying to communicate.

# In sum

Good communication is communication that your target audience understands
via the medium you chose. Whether it's a text, email, or actually speaking
out loud, if you can get the point across effectively, you did good.
