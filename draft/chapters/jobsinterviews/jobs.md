# Jobs

People panic *a lot* about jobs, especially with the ongoing AI
shenanigans. Perhaps the panic is warranted, but if you believe
in yourself and *your degree* (assuming you're pursuing one), you
will be just fine.

Just know that you may not always get the heavy-hitter companies
first: Google, Amazon, Apple, et cetera. They might take a bit
more experience and a bit more networking, **but that's okay!**

## The job search

Please, for the love, do not search up internships or jobs based on
salary. The money will come - you work in a lucrative field already.
Search for companies that excite you to work at and align with your
values. Realistically, you may not always get these jobs, but you
can work toward them and you should start with them first.

**Especially with internships**, go for quantity over quality. In
a competitive and somewhat oversaturated market, experience anywhere
is better than no experience at all. Apply around and see what you can
get, and then evaluate your options from there. In my internship search
for Summer '24, I applied to **~140 companies**, didn't hear back from
about **50 companies**, got rejected from over **80 companies**, and got
**two offers** [^ref1], one of which was partially from networking.

**Network, network, network**. Companies want to hire good people, and
if you know good people, they will hopefully know you and recommend you [^ref2].
This trumps everything else; if you network, it's an immediate in at the company
which gets you past a lot of the initial interview shenanigans or through them
even if you do poorly. 

I know a lot of young people in similar situations to me think networking is 
cheating or morally wrong; e.g. they want to get a job on their own merits.
I can see that perspective, but ultimately you should take what you can get.
A lot of people network [^ref3]; it's normal! And, assuming you get hired,
you've already got a friend there who is looking out for you, which is a
*great* feeling.

## Decisions

**A decision is hard because you don't have all of the information
to make it**. Deciding to move somewhere for a job is super tough.
Thinking if the company culture is right for your personality is super tough.
Figuring out if the company aligns with your career and personal ambitions is super 
tough. But you're not locked in forever.

Recently I heard about the [40-70 rule](https://www.42courses.com/blog/home/2019/12/10/colin-powells-40-70-rule) which states that "you need between 40 and 70 percent of
the total information to make a decision." This is a great way of summing up my mantra
above: decisions are hard, and often you don't have enough time to get all of the
information, so do your best to get most of it - at least 40%, so you don't cut yourself
short, and at most 70%, because you probably don't have time to get more and it might
make the decision harder.

Trust your instincts and intuition: if it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out, and
that's fine! There are plenty more fish in the sea. If it *does* work out, great!


[^ref1]: I don't give these numbers to be depressing. In fact, a lot of friends
I send this to actually seem reassured by my plight. So I'm sharing it here too. :)

[^ref2]: ..and get a sweet bonus if you're hired; it's a win-win-win for you,
the people who you networked with, and the company.

[^ref3]: Not to say that something is OK because everyone does it; however,
networking is pretty standard.
