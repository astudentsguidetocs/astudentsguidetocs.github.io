# Team players

Not everyone needs to manage. I feel like often times, the progression
at work or even in sports teams as you get more senior is that you *must*
be a leader. Perhaps this is effective if you're seriously lacking a leader,
but the point is, not everyone wants to be a leader.

In Tony Fadell's *Build*, he calls these types of people individual contributors (ICs).
He notes that, once you become a manager, you're doing less of what did you successful.
As such, it's probably going to be scary! In the software engineering sense, you're not
coding as much anymore. If you're the type who want to code for the rest of your career,
there are paths forward that allow for that too.

As someone more leadership-inclined, I love good team players and seriously respect
them. If I give them a task, they do it. And it's not just like they're following me
blindly: I love working with these people because they are willing to roll their sleeves
up and work *together* even if they're not leading the product vision.

**A leader is a team player**. They're apart of a team, so why wouldn't they be?
But even more than that, if you're a leader, you should know when to step down
and listen to your team players. Often times they'll be the expert and know more
than you about something, and you can treasure that and use that to the entire
team's advantage.
