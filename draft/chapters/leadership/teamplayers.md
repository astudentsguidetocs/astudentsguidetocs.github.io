# Team Players



<!-- Not everyone needs to manage- see individual contributors; and as a manager, you’re doing less of what you did; the “Star player” or “team player” type - I’d rather hire a lot of these good team players than one star player; the team players/ICs who don’t need to go into leadership are super rare but valuable -->
