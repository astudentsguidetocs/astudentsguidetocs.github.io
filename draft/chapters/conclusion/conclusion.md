# Parting Thoughts

If I had to boil down my advice to just a short sentence or two,
I would say to be open minded and self reflective. And truly,
*genuinely*, listen to people and care about them.

I started programming on November 23rd, 2015. (I know because I had
bought an online course that day.) I'm coming up on **ten years** of coding,
and I am by no means an expert at everything. I'm definitely pretty good
at some things. I'm still learning a lot of things too. I'm proud of
where I came from, just making fun things for my friends and I in Minecraft,
to following my newfound dreams of going to Mines and studying computer science.

I have no idea where my career is going to take me. And, honestly,
I don't know how much I'll code, because I like leadership and management. But
I'm open to it all, and I'm confident that I can work with people. I'm going
to fail and I'm going to make mistakes, but that's all part of the ride.

I hope you learned a thing or two reading this. Check out [my website](https://ezrichards.github.io)
if you want to get in touch.

Thanks for listening.
