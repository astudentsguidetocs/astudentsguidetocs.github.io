# At the job

Great, you got the job. The fun doesn't end there though:
you can still be proactive and drive your career and life
in the direction you want to. Here are some thoughts on
the matter in no particular order:

**Schedule regular meetings with your boss**, assuming they don't
already schedule meetings with you. This was one of the greatest
strengths of my old boss: he genuinely wanted to know how I was
doing often and would truly listen and try to change things if I
felt I wasn't doing important work or moving where I wanted to
in the job. This is also a great chance to get to know your boss
more depending on how extroverted they are.

**Be nice to people**: okay, stick with me here. You should be nice
all of the time, but every once and awhile, it doesn't hurt to be
really nice. Do something nice for a coworker you like (or dislike);
buy breakfast burritos for a morning meeting, or pay for someone's lunch [^ref1].
I'm not saying I was or am stellar at this, but I made an effort at least a few
times. One coworker and good friend made consistently thoughtful efforts,
and everyone in the office came to like him and he quickly got more involved
in office events [^ref2].

**Get to know people**: I sound like a broken record, but this is really
important too. Get to know people and their motivations: they're working toward
something the same as you, whether it's a promotion or simply something for a loved one.
Remembering things about people goes a long way, especially in the never ending
churn of standups where your team might try to talk about something other than work.

**Keep learning**: everything we've spoken about applies. Have a growth mindset;
you don't need to be flawless all of the time, you can and will make mistakes. 
Learn from them, and keep learning! You don't know where and when some of the things
you'll learn will pop up again; sometimes they won't show up at all, and sometimes
they will be the key to your next big project.


[^ref1]: One of my coworkers was so stubborn about this and would not stop
Venmo-ing me back, so I hid a $20 bill in his notebook that he found months later
after the internship had ended. I win! *(If you're reading this, please don't
pay me back.)*

[^ref2]: Don't do it for the purpose of gaining favors or fame; people can tell when it's fake. [I'm looking at you, Dwight Schrute.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaK2P19sWHU&pp=ygUSZHdpZ2h0IGJhZ2VsIHNjZW5l) I'm just saying to be nice and you will probably
enjoy your job and the people around you more, and the people around you will enjoy you more.
