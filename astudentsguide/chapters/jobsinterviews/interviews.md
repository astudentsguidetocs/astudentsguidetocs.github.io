# Interviews

Interviews are a two-way street: in an ideal world, it doesn't
matter too much about how you perform in the interview, it's
for the interviewers to see if you would fit in their teams
and cultures both skill and personality wise; you also should
be doing the same.

I've spoken with a lot of HR people and tech directors alike,
and they all seem to agree: your attitude is more important than
how good you are at coding. It's how you show the process of how 
you solve the problem, react to adversity, and show your personality in general.

You might get asked things like:
- What is a time when you made a mistake and how did you fix it?
- Let's say you're behind on a project. How do you rectify the situation?
- Name one time you were challenged and how you overcame the challenge.

I always hate these questions. It's hard to think on the spot (maybe I just
need to prep more.. guilty!) and for instance, I rarely find myself behind
on projects because I try to keep ahead [^ref1]. But the point is: just try to answer 
these honestly. You should get to the point ([STAR method](https://www.vawizard.org/wiz-pdf/STAR_Method_Interviews.pdf)), but I often find these questions as opportunities
to get a bit of personality across. Sprinkle in something you found funny or
interesting about the project you were challenged on. Tell them what technology
you learned from a mistake.

Once you make it through the sea of unappealing questions, it's your time to shine.

You could ask things like:
- What's the most challenging thing you're working on? Do you find the problems
you're working on interesting?
- How do you like your managers? Do they notice your hard work?
- What's your favorite and least favorite part about the work you do?

I like these questions because they put you in a closer position to what it
would actually be like at the job. They help you imagine yourself in that exact role,
which is good for you to find out if you want to be there; and it shows good interest
to the interviewer.

I would also note that some of these questions could have negative responses. We're
not trying to goad bad answers out of people (and **rarely, if ever** will you hear
any interviewer say *anything* bad about the company), but you do get honest answers.
I've heard things like "I don't like working with technology X or edge case Y," which is
really insightful to know going into the job. And if you don't get honest answers, or
answers feel forced and practiced in advance, do you really want to work there?

Also, there is a slightly different set of questions I would ask for a non-technical
or human resources type interview, but still valuable:
- What's the culture like?
- What's the room for career growth like at _____?
- What do successful people in this role look like?

These questions show you're genuinely interested in working at the company
and are trying to imagine what your life would be like there -- which are
things you *should* be genuinely interested in.

## In sum

You could read a hundred interview books and blog posts, watch a hundred
interview prep YouTube videos, do LeetCode problems until you're insane [^ref2],
and it will *maybe probably somewhat mostly* prepare you, right?

But when it comes down to it, **just be yourself**. Get your personality across,
and **interview the company** as much as they're interviewing you.


[^ref1]: One time I was super vague and sort of made stuff up as an answer to
this question. The big tech senior director interviewing me fully called me out 
and was like "yeah, it sounds like you didn't really actually have that experience."
Lesson learned: Be honest! And on a related note, I ended up not choosing that job
for a few reasons, but one factor was that I didn't feel super respected from him
nor did I feel a lot of interest.

[^ref2]: In the rare event that a company is reading this: Please stop! LeetCode,
HackerRank, CodeSignals, are such a joke. When am I ever going to implement Tetris
at my job (assuming I don't work at Tetris ðŸ™ƒ)? When will I ever implement an RB-tree
traversal? I think HackerRank and CodeSignal are beginning to do this, but measure me
on what I actually will be doing - writing APIs, database queries, designing frontends, et
cetera. There's a way to show applicants actually know how to code without gamifying it.
