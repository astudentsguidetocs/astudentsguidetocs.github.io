There is an abundance of knowledge as well as classes
at universities you could take on this, but let me throw
out some ideas.

Testing methods are a great idea when you want to see
how users *actually* use your product (which you should
want, and you should want to do **early** instead of once
the product is done). Here's a good article on introductory
[usability testing](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-testing-101/)
and another guide on [research methods](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2017/10/27/a-comprehensive-guide-to-ux-research-methods?ef_id=Cj0KCQiAsaS7BhDPARIsAAX5cSDrtOOXlO_PoCeFVQOns9MvBL0WGPm8ZlcrcchR2sUhkGGexO83m08aAjLhEALw_wcB:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!710903109812!!!g!!!21623726828!167280597758&sdid=ZP46F2GS&mv=search&mv2=paidsearch&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAAD3lWjw3wLeEKztqaXtnX7ow2LLrY&gclid=Cj0KCQiAsaS7BhDPARIsAAX5cSDrtOOXlO_PoCeFVQOns9MvBL0WGPm8ZlcrcchR2sUhkGGexO83m08aAjLhEALw_wcB).

[Cognitive walkthrough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_walkthrough)s are another
great tool for looking at the usability of your design or your system.

Even if your job title doesn't include the words "user interface" (UI) 
or "user experience" (UX), you should still be thinking of your end user.

Who are they? (e.g. make some [personas](https://www.uxdesigninstitute.com/blog/what-are-ux-personas/))
What do they like and dislike? What situations do they get into when using your product?
What are they trying to achieve? Your product solves a problem; is the user
able to solve their problem with your product?

These are all great questions to answer and to **test**. You can't think
through all of these; at some point, you need to see the reality of how
your design is being used.

We spoke about it a bit already, but it's worth mentioning that part of designing 
for your users is designing for *everyone* - see *Accessibility* section.
