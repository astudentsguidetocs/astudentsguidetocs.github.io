# Accessibility

It's shocking how little people know about accessibility. Most
people who know seem to know someone with a disability or have one themselves. 
I learned a lot about this in Human-Computer Interaction, which is a great
introduction to overall design thinking but also had emphasis on accessible design.

You should want to accommodate for accessibility without any external motivators, 
but a lot of these things are required [by law](https://www.ada.gov/resources/web-guidance/) now anyways.

For instance, have you heard of the following things?
- A [skip to main content link](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G1.html#:~:text=Example%202%3A%20A%20%22Skip%20to,skip%20over%20the%20navigation%20tools.)
- [Screen readers](https://www.afb.org/blindness-and-low-vision/using-technology/assistive-technology-products/screen-readers)
- The [WCAG guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)
- [Heading level accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/headings/)
- [and more](https://mn.gov/admin/at/getting-started/understanding-at/types/)

..if you said no, you probably wouldn't consider them when building up your 
website either [^ref1]. And you definitely **should** consider those things.

The argument here, if any, is that there's never enough time or money to do it.
Especially in a startup, you're working on getting a product out of the door
and in consumers' hands as soon as possible. I won't tell you how to run your
startup or company, but I will encourage you to think eventually (and hopefully
sooner rather than later) about how accessible your products are. Designing
for a wider audience of people should be appealing.

I'm not pretending to be some expert on accessibility and I hope to learn much
more and also share and teach much more as I advance in my career. I just hope
I've convinced you to care (or even learn just a bit) about accessibility too.
I hope not, but some day you or I may be affected by something, and I would 
hope that the software and hardware we use can support our needs.

[^ref1]: If you *have* heard of these things, great! Spread the word.
