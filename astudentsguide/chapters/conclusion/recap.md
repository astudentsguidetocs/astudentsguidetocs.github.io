# Recap

Throughout this mini book, I spoke about a lot of my experiences
and recommendations as to what helped me succeed in CS up to now.

I spoke about what computer science and software engineering are,
what building blocks help, and what makes a *great* computer scientist
(the practical, the theory, and the person). I spoke about the hunt for
good code, and whether or not comments matter (the jury's still out); 
we spoke about our never ending battle against complexity.

I elaborated on the mindsets and attitude that help you thrive with others; modesty,
work life balance, constructive feedback, and more. I opened up about my experiences
with work-life balance, saying no, and self care. I also sprinkled in a bit of talk
about productivity.

We spoke about vital perspectives in computer science, and how to accommodate
more diverse views as well as difficult people. I spoke a lot about people altogether;
people and teams are also vital. We spoke about what makes great communication,
leadership, team players, and teams themselves.

We spoke about design principles, patterns, and practices, that you'll find
everywhere (or at least I have). Finally, I spoke about jobs and interviews and things that may help you out there.
