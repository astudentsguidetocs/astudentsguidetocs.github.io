# What is computer science?

Computer science, as I learned it in my CS1 course, is "the study of algorithms."

A Google dictionary definition says "the study of the principles and use of computers."

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) says "Computer science is the study of computation, information, and automation."

While these aren't necessarily incorrect definitions, I think they miss out on part of the story.
Computer science, to me, is the blend of computational theory, practical software + hardware engineering,
and problem solving. Computer science is as much of an art as it is a science; the science comes from the
concrete theory, mathematics, etc., whereas the art comes from the people and the problem solving.

There's no precise formula, mathematical proof, or scary AI replacement for problem solving (thank goodness, or I 
would be out of a job) nor is there one for working with real people and real teams. Nor is there one for making good 
decisions [^ref].

## What is software engineering?

A fan-favorite CS site, [Geeks4Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering-introduction-to-software-engineering/), says: "Software Engineering 
is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software." This looks
suspiciously close to the [Wikipedia definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering),
but I think we're all in agreement here.

Software engineering isn't *just* sitting and writing code for eye-straining amounts of time;
it's about designing to serve real people's needs, testing to ensure safety in critical operations,
and thinking about the longevity of the software produced.

## What's the difference?

I was once pretty confused on this difference. I was quickly corrected. Software engineering is a subset of Computer 
Science, but as mentioned, it's not **all** of Computer Science. A lot of professors and important people in
higher education will argue that a college degree in CS is better than an online bootcamp or course solely
about software engineering or coding. While the money in the pockets of the people educated by bootcamps might
disagree, I think this idea is sound. Understanding the full picture of Computer Science will help you be a
better software engineer, which is the main job outcome [^ref2].

## What *isn't* software engineering?

I might be too much of an idealist, but I don't think software engineering is about the paycheck.
I'm always pretty grossed out and disappointed by all of those people on LinkedIn looking at 
[levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi) comparisons of which company is going to give them $900k a
year and work them into the ground; or the relatively newfound ["ghost" software engineers](https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-companies-ghost-engineers-stanford-underperformers-coding-2024-11), 
who work multiple remote jobs and get paid more for less [^ref3].

Yes, the paycheck is nice. Yes, it can positively change your quality of life. But if you're doing 
it only for that reason, I think you will be left disappointed and frustrated.

Software engineering **is** getting frustrated at a problem but working diligently for hours,
days, weeks, months, and years to fix it. It's hours of debugging, only for the sweet
relief of a fix.

I'm not saying I enjoy being frustrated for hours and days on end, but I recognize the necessity
of that process, and seeing the fix or the final product makes it all worth it for me. But if
you're not on board with that contract, it's going to be a rough ride.


[^ref]: The pessimists among us finished this thought with: ...yet. Yes, AI+ML exists, and it's good. But also,
we needn't worry about that day until it arrives.

[^ref2]: Even if you don't go into software engineering, CS helps in a *lot* of different ways and has many other job outcomes.

[^ref3]: This is a relatively new and disputed theory from Stanford, but I am aware of people who have already done this at the internship level in college.
