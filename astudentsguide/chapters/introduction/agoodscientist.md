# A "great" computer scientist

What makes a computer scientist "good" or "bad" is pretty
subjective, and my goal here is not to say anything bad about
people. Instead, I want to say what makes computer scientists
*great* - beyond average; beyond good; what are the traits of
the people making startups, doing fascinating research, or
simply even those people who are steadfast and enjoyable to work with.

I've come up with this (probably not comprehensive) guideline of
what makes a great computer scientist, and it's not all about coding
(though, it's important!). 

This section is here to say why we study these different areas
and how we can strive to have more a more holistic understanding
of the field. We're not putting anybody down with this. In fact,
I encourage you to think of the parts you're better at. I was
never good at the theory.

## The Practical

This is the code part. Can you write code? Okay, that sounds
simple, but in software engineering terms, this is obviously
really important.

I've spoken to senior engineers and directors from big companies, 
and they seem to agree: what elevates a developer (especially in 
terms of junior/senior roles) is their ability to notice patterns within 
code and make refactors that make the project better. Better could mean 
saving people time working on it, helping its longevity, or even improving 
its architecture.

More abstractly, can you take any problem and implement it? This could look
like a backend, or this could look like a beautiful website. Either way,
you're that person who doesn't back down from a problem and quite simply,
implements it and implements it well! I.e., you factor in maintainability,
readability, and clarity.

## The Theory

The theory part: hear me out, even though I'll hopefully and probably
never have to whip up a mathematical proof on the job site, I think the
theory allows you to do three things: communicate, teach, and leverage power.

Communicating: This is the most important part in my opinion. My research advisor
(who I would definitely classify as a *great* computer scientist) was great at this;
he would pull out seemingly random analogies from formal language theory, the theory
of computation, operating systems, or other broad CS-things. This helped us develop
our research so much; and it's interesting, if you really think, how much abstract ideas
could potentially relate to each other. (e.g. we used formal language theory grammars
to help think about how we define a taxonomy for concepts in a curriculum.) 

Teaching: Again, even if you're never going to touch a proof for the rest of your
life, knowing more about systems and things as a whole isn't going to do you any
harm. I think it will do a lot of good; on the same lines of communicating, it will
help you communicate and teach more complex ideas to others.

The power: The AI-boom wouldn't have happened without the theory and the math.
Doing cooler and more complex things often needs a slightly deeper understanding
than just implementation details of a programming language; this can also be a
great reason to know the theory.

## The Person

I saved the best for last: the person could be the most important of all.
Even if you know the practical stuff and the theory, you could be a pain
to work with. Being a great communicator, friend, and coworker can go a
long, long way. I don't want to stereotype a group I'm definitely apart of,
but often, CS people can be thought of as "awkward" or not really personable.
The good news: it just takes practice! The more interesting things you do aside
from sitting at your computer staring at lines of code, the more you can share
with others and the more personable you become [^ref1].

So, be a human. Nobody expects you to be a workaholic (assuming you work at a
company that respects your health) and just be a code-producing machine. The 
overall point I'm making: talk with other people! A great computer scientist
knows when to switch off and talk about their life and ask people about theirs.

### The Mindset

I'll have an entire section on mindset and perspectives a
little later, but I think it's worth mentioning that
good computer scientists in my eyes are **open-minded**
and perseverant. How else are we going to keep up with
the ever-growing [list of programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages),
frameworks, and all the rest?


[^ref1]: A gross oversimplification, but my point is to encourage people in CS
to think about other people and things outside of your work!
