# Failure

For the first two to three years at Mines, I felt like I was always
failing. Whether it was literally failing a class [^ref1], failing myself
when I didn't understand things in CS, failing to make friends, failing to
stay healthy or otherwise. 

This may come as a surprise since I often portray a calm and collected
persona, but for those three years, there wasn't a semester where I didn't
think about dropping out or transferring away. But I kept going.

## How to get back up

This is always the hardest part. After so many failures in a row,
it just gets exhausting. This sounds clich√©, but you have to get back
up, even when you feel lower than you ever have before. That's when
you find out your limits and go beyond them.

**Talk to people you trust**. That's what friends are for - picking
each other up when you fail or feel down! I guarantee there is someone,
whether it's family, friend, coworker, etc, they will care.

**Failure doesn't define you, it builds you**. It doesn't say anything
about who you are or who you're always bound to be; it's just an opportunity
for you to learn and change. Every time you learn and change, you widen
your perspectives and horizons.


[^ref1]: I failed calculus 2 my first semester! Being good at math equating
to being a good computer scientist is an old and outdated myth. On a related note,
failing a class is much more common that it seems, there's just a lot of built up
and unnecessary shame around it.
