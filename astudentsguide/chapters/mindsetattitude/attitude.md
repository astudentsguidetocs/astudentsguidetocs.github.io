# Attitude

Let me preface this chapter by say that can totally take or leave my advice.
As with this whole book, I'm just here to say what has worked for me and made
me enjoy my teams more.

Attitude is important in CS. Sometimes I think that this is the crucial thing
that differentiates a computer scientist from other people, even if they know
how to code.

Since I started coding at a young age, I grew up with friends who would always
be worried about what they were going to do after high school, and they would always
ask me for inspiration. I would simply say computer science, because I knew at that
point and had a dream. Those friends would often give coding an honest effort and
be able to code, but never really enjoyed it. It's not to say those 
friends couldn't have learned the mindset and the field - some of these friends
I know are now studying neuroscience and psychology, and I'm sure they're going to go great
places in their careers. But whether or not they wanted to commit their life to the
ups and downs of coding (see *What is computer science?*) is a different question,
and one they probably answered well. 

If I'm ever asked for advice by high schoolers, undecided majors, or people alike on
going into CS, I tell them it can be great, but I also make it abundantly clear what 
they're getting into and that they'll need the right attitude, mindset, and a *lot* of patience.

## Remember where you came from

So many computer scientists I know are so humble and modest that I questioned even
writing this section. But you're bound to get a few big egos every now and then.
Whether it's because they invented some great technology or startup or maybe they
make three figures more than you, these people are sometimes not great to work with.

Try to stay grounded. Remember when you could barely write a line of code, and remember
those people who took you under their wing and showed you the ropes. I think this is
especially important so that we can bring new people and new ideas into the field. It
rarely ever hurts to be humble [^ref1].

You're probably better than a lot of people in some ways. And a lot worse in others.
And equivalent in others. This is just life. You might have a lot to say about one
thing, but on another topic, you might just take the backseat and let the expert explain.

## Perseverance

I probably don't need a chapter on this either, as this is a universal experience
at this point throughout many professions. But beyond just perseverance, **perseverance
with patience** seems to be the key while coding.

Yes, your code will break. Yes, you will be angry, frustrated, and/or disappointed. But
if you can be patient and recognize that it will get better if you put your mind to it,
you will succeed. If you can believe this, you can also inspire your team to work
through the hard things and be patient as you develop something great over time. 

## Growth Mindset

> *Growth mindset*, simply stated, is a learner’s belief that their intelligence can expand and develop.
In contrast, *fixed mindset* is a learner’s belief that their intelligence is a fixed, immutable trait.
\- [Stanford/Carol Dweck](https://teachingcommons.stanford.edu/teaching-guides/foundations-course-design/learning-activities/growth-mindset-and-enhanced-learning#:~:text=Growth%20mindset%2C%20simply%20stated%2C%20is,is%20a%20fixed%2C%20immutable%20trait.)

Again, I think growth mindset is something you've probably heard of by now
and is universal across all professions. But if not, there it is! Your
intelligence is **not** fixed. Your beliefs aren't fixed either. You
can grow and change - and that's the beauty of it.

There will be things you don't know. Always. Forever. And you have to
believe that you have the ability to learn it, even when it seems like
rocket science. Start small, put in the time, and you'll get there.

Additionally, while this may be a more cynical view of growth: adapt 
before you're left behind; or even better, keep an open mind
toward new people, new teams, and new technologies. CS as a field
always moves forward quickly, whether it's a groundbreaking discovery
like generative AI or a new JavaScript framework.


[^ref1]: This is crazy, but sometimes I think people can be *too* humble. Nothing
wrong with smiling and accepting your award, but if you have trouble taking the award
in the first place, that's a different story.
