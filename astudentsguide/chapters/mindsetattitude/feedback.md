# Feedback

I took a class called Tech Startups from the founder of [Piazza](https://piazza.com), 
Pooja Sankar. In addition to her teaching *Difficult Conversations*, she spoke a lot
about feedback (which I believe was inspired by the book [^ref1]).

If you're like me, you're probably wondering what all the fuss is about feedback.
It's such a common word with perhaps even negative connotations; e.g. you try to give
feedback to someone and they don't listen, or annoying survey on the internet
are pestering you to give feedback about some service.

The type of feedback we're talking about here is centered around personal growth
and true, undivided attention which leads to *real* listening.

This is the type of feedback that helps people *change* and *grow*. Feedback 
can make a meaningful difference in running a team or in any sort of organization.

# Feedback is a gift

One of the few files I saved from that class was Pooja's lecture on feedback;
I give full credit to her for some of these explanations, but I'll add my own
commentary to a few of the points:

> **Feedback is a gift**. It is an opportunity to connect with the other person
and to build exceptional relationships. - Pooja Sankar, 2024 [emphasis added]

This is to say that viewing other people's criticism as an attack on yourself
is unproductive and missing the point. View feedback and constructive criticism
as a chance for both parties to get to know each other more and both improve in
certain ways. It's a gift!

Again, citing heavily from Pooja [^ref2], giving feedback well looks like:
- Leading with your intentions: be honest and open so the other person can be too.
- Make it a conversation, rather than rant from one person
- Focus on what actually happened, avoid speculating on intent
- Check in with the other person and *listen*: how are they interpreting you, and 
what do they need to move forward.

Receiving feedback well looks like:
- Being kind and courteous, e.g. thanking the other person for sharing feedback & their time.
- Fight the urge to be or appear defensive: you're both being open and candid with each other.
- Ask questions to develop a **genuine** understanding; be curious about *their* story and *their* understanding.
- Repeat back what you heard and interpreted - it may be different from what they intended!

This was such a big deal in our class that I think we spent multiple weeks on it; we at
least spent one week and had multiple scheduled feedback sessions with the class and our
own group.

I am so confident in this approach that I have used it twice before in my own teams. In
one academic team, there was a falling out between two members [^ref3]. My boss had handled
it fairly well, but I thought I could do even better and try to create a more friendly 
environment for them to work in. I invited them both to sit down with me in an empty
classroom, and I acted as a moderator upholding the rules above. I quite literally opened 
up the slide deck on feedback and gave them an abridged version of the lecture beforehand. 
I'm not  sure how much they both truly listened to each other, but I know they at least listened 
more than they would have, had they done it over text or even in-person one on one. 
They went on to work more respectfully with each other and accept their differences.

Another time in my side projects, I was working with someone I found quite difficult [^ref4].
We would get so riled up and angry at each other; there was no hope of ever resolving things.
We couldn't really even keep it to a respectful discussion about work - personality and other nasty claims got involved (not saying I am free of guilt, I contributed greatly to the problem).
What I realized was that I wasn't actually **listening**. I was just trying to give feedback
to someone who wasn't open to it. I didn't understand their needs and spaces in which they
would be comfortable to discuss. It hurt, and it hurt both of us for a prolonged period of time.
But after opening up some of those wounds and being curious about each other's intentions and
true feelings, we were able to heal and work together in a much more efficient and friendly way.

[^ref2]: Pooja's slides aren't public anywhere, but these points were bulleted on her slides.
With my knowledge from her, the class, and *Difficult Conversations*, I've added some points
and fleshed out the explanations.

[^ref3]: Names, titles, and pronouns are all redacted here for anonymity; feedback requires
a lot of opening up, and it's not fair for me to get into specifics here about who did.

[^ref4]: We're actually good friends now, as these things often go. :) I'll also have
a future section on how to work with "difficult people."
