# Work-life balance

One time I had lunch with a few executives from a fairly
large tech company [^ref1]. At one point, one of the executives
had asked me something along the lines of: "So imagine we're on
the brink of a discovery/innovation and you need to work late. Are 
you willing to work overtime without any pay if you're close?"

Looking back, this may have been a slight red flag, but in the moment
I had responded with some noncommittal answer leaning towards "no," which
if I read the room correctly, may have been the wrong answer. Those guys
seemed to be looking for students who would give it their all and work long
hours, which isn't bad if that's what you want -- but I think the pursuit of
"great things," especially in a startup environment, can start to blur the
lines with your health and life, and therein lies our issues in CS with
work-life balance [^ref2].

With the world being more digital than ever [^ref3], it's so easy to just
write one more line of code on your laptop when you're at home, or do
more coding, more thinking, more engineering, etc. If you're getting Teams
or Slack notifications on your phone, you'll probably keep on thinking
about your work too. This "blurring of the lines" is, in my opinion, why
so many people struggle to make compromises between their work and life,
and if done wrong, it can lead to burnout.

One thing I realized that adults and older people (at least than the college age)
do well is set boundaries. They're not afraid to 'be judged' and say no to
going to a party and go sleep or take care of themselves instead. They're not
afraid to say 'no thanks, I don't want to stay late today.' If you're a college-age
person reading this, I think that's a great skill to learn.

Building boundaries means setting up things in your life: e.g. exercise time,
time to eat, and time for friends, that are non negotiables as you work. That way,
you've got the foundations to be healthy while still working.

## Burnout

I'm by no means a health expert. I'm not even sure if I've officially had
burnout before, but there have been two times in school where I think
I've felt it [^ref4]: I felt numb. I listen to music at least a few hours
of every day, and no music would sound good anymore; it almost irritated me.
Interactions with people seemed less interesting and meaningful, and I didn't
even feel stressed, because I just felt so numb to everything.

Regardless of whether or not that was burnout or not, and regardless of the
fact that burnout may manifest differently in people: life is a lot better
when you don't feel incredibly numb or hopeless.

So, you just need to draw a line. Build some boundaries. Find ways to
make your life *yours*: play sports, play an instrument, see friends,
see loved ones, et cetera, **outside** of work. When you're working, you
can push if you're excited about something, but if you find yourself
pushing over a prolonged period of time (> 1 week), maybe reconsider the
arrangement.

The entire next section speaks about how to say no and build boundaries
in your life. This is also key in avoiding burnout and maintaining a healthy
work-life balance. And -- for the record -- I don't like the expression "maintaining 
a healthy work-life balance." It seems like a [love like ghosts](https://genius.com/Lord-huron-love-like-ghosts-lyrics) [^ref5] situation: everybody talks but nobody knows.
Or, everybody talks but seems to disregard their own advice and do their own thing.

The best thing you can do is to **find what works for you**; stress is a normal part of
life, but if you become incapacitated or depressed over it, you need to change something,
and hopefully quickly. The good news is that there are *so many* options for help:
don't be scared, just do a quick Google search.

always get what you always got. No matter what it is. [^ref6]

[^ref2]: I've been reading [Build](https://www.buildc.com/the-book?ref=producthunt) by Tony Fadell
(who co-created the iPod and iPhone) and he also has some good thoughts on this. Try and
fail and succeed as you do, but don't hurt yourself (literally or metaphorically) working
long hours in your twenties.

[^ref3]: Sorry, sorry. I know. How many times have we heard this boring clich√©?

[^ref4]: For more information on burnout, please do your own research and **get help**
if you're struggling; [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/burnout/art-20046642) seems like a good place to start on the topic.

[^ref5]: Bit of a cynical Lord Huron reference. I love Lord Huron, and I think
the metaphor holds up OK here.

motivational YouTube video I watched, but genuinely life changing advice.
