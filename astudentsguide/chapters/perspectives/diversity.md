# Diversity in CS

**Wait! Don't skip this chapter** if you're one of those people living in
the stone ages. Diversity is important, it benefits everyone, and you can help.

[Brotopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotopia) \[[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Brotopia-Breaking-Boys-Silicon-Valley/dp/0735213534)] by Emily Chang is a great book, though it almost reads like a
report, on all of the unfortunate things that happen in Silicon Valley, particularly to women in CS.
I always wanted to work in Silicon Valley, but now I'm thinking twice about working there (assuming
it's not at an established company like Apple/Google). *Brotopia* has damning chapters on the founders
and the cultures that thrive in the valley. Spoiler: from the beginning (perhaps it has gotten better since),
it's been white males.

As a white male in CS, I'm not helping the ratios nor the stereotypes, but as
I'll harp on in the next section, we can help out by **simply listening**. Hear
**everyone's** experiences and ask them how *you* can support *them*.

I know multiple folks who identify as LGBTQ+ but wouldn't want to be treated any
differently or thought of differently if they came out to their friends or coworkers.
It's understandable, and it's scary to come out, nonetheless in a field like this
and in a society like this.

**When people say bad things**, call them out or tell somebody with the authority 
to stop it. Definitely don't encourage them or give them a laugh out of pity.
I've been in awkward situations where someone makes a "joke" with someone 
in the room who would be offended by it. It's not to say you can't make jokes,
but you can't joke about things that are going to make people feel uncomfortable or unsafe.

Even if you "don't believe in diversity" (which is wrong), you should recognize
that **diversity makes great teams and great products**. Quite simply, more people
with more experiences means that your team has more perspectives, which in turn
means your product isn't as blindsided or biased to just one experience; your
product becomes more universal.

The bottom line is: **stay open-minded and listen**. It will serve us all well.
