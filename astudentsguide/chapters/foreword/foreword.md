# Foreword

Hi, my name is Ethan Richards, and at the time of writing, I'm a senior in
Computer Science at the [Colorado School of Mines](https://www.mines.edu). I'm 
working on finishing up my undergraduate degree (graduating May '25), but I've 
also been pursuing my masters and am also nearly done with that too (graduating Dec '25).

I'll make this foreword brief and answer the questions that you're probably
asking: *What gives me the qualifications to write a book about computer science
and software engineering? What is even the point of this book?*

I think I'm a fairly well respected figure, at least in the [CS@Mines](https://cs.mines.edu) 
circles. My college career has had a special emphasis on CS education; I helped design
our introductory CS course, CSCI128, helped with our Systems Programming course, CSCI210,
and also got my [research published at SIGCSE 2024](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3626253.3635535).
My masters project is designing a UI/UX course for the department. I've been a lead TA for 128 since 
its inception (and I love it!). I was also president of the largest CS club at Mines, 
[Mines ACM](https://acm.mines.edu), for a year, and I had various involvement with other roles 
for about 3 years. I also ran the [Mines High School Programming Competition](https://mineshspc.com) 
for two years.

I'm not here to talk about companies (go stalk my LinkedIn if you care), but I've
had one internship (and another for my dad's company, if you want to count that), with
another lined up for Summer '25. Also, I don't like mentioning this for a lot of reasons 
(some of which I'll talk about later!), but I started programming when I was 12. 
Obviously, this still does not make me an expert of all things software-engineering, 
but I have seen a lot of things across the realms of academia, real world software,
and otherwise that I would love to share that helped me along my journey and 
helped me succeed up to this point.

The purpose of this book is not for me to brag like I just did (sorry) -- it's all about
my understanding of the things that make CS + software engineering what it is, and the
people the way they are, and how we all can succeed both individually and together in this field. Enjoy!

<!-- why i'm writing: building a habit of writing/practicing communication + also as a reflective process -->
