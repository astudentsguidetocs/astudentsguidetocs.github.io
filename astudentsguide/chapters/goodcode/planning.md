# Planning

This might seem like the most obvious section of this entire work.
But I think you would be surprised at just how *little* people actually
plan what they're doing. I think these habits often come from academia:
for the most part, you get an assignment, you get an idea of how to code
it, and you just go ahead and code it. Or, even if you want to plain,
time constraints can make it feel like it's not worth your time.

Part of the other issue I've noticed in industry is Agile. Agile has
its strengths, but I feel like a good old fashioned planning session or
design document is lost with Agile; it's all about that next ticket and
how many points it's worth [^ref1] without considering the bigger picture [^ref2].

## Drawing it out

Whenever I'm faced with a problem, I give it an honest attempt and then
immediately *after* I draw it out or write out what I'm trying to do. (Yes, I am
guilty of not planning up front either.)

But I've noticed this same quality in a lot of high-functioning professors, PhD students,
engineers, and more. They're *always* drawing things out and trying to understand things
in their head. You don't have to be a good artist to do this; the best sketches
come in the form of scratchy, messy, incoherent writings on whatever napkin or
paper is nearby.

As an aside, I certainly hope you're *drawing it out* if you're in the realm of
frontend/UI/UX design; pop open Figma or just go "old fashioned" with
some pen and paper.

## Commenting

Often times, when I plan: *the code writes itself*. I find people's use of
[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) pretty funny, as normally people
don't comment code half as well, but when you're trying to tell the genAI what
you're going for, you tend to explain yourself a little better and more clearly
until it gets the right code that you're looking for. It's the same idea:
if you outline your code, you (or AI) can write it pretty quickly. I'll have
an entire section on comments though.


[^ref1]: God, I hate pointing, don't get me started.

[^ref2]: Yes, the more senior engineers are considering the bigger picture,
but I feel like us lowly junior-engineer-bug-fixers are often not involved in that
when it can actually be really important.
