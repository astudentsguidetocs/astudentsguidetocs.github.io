*There Are So Many Acronyms In Computer Science*. Did
you guess that one? Sometimes I feel like the art of 
computer science is being able to guess the acronym of
whatever obscure thing you're using [^ref1].

There are some fundamental ones that I think
are well-worth talking about in no particular order:

**DRY**: Do Not Repeat Yourself. This one is self-explanatory,
but let's say you're a 12 year old coding things for Minecraft,
and you wanted to repeat an action 250 times. Will you copy the 
same line 250 times or use a for loop? Hopefully the latter. [^ref2]

But even at a higher level, if you're repeating yourself: make a
function. Make a class. Make some abstract classes and interfaces.

*If you're repeating yourself, there's almost always a better way.*

**YAGNI**: You Ain't/Aren't Gonna Need It. If you don't need it,
don't use it. If it's not a problem yet, it's not a problem.
Don't bloat code for no reason, or even features in your product.

**TDD**: Test Driven Development. The enemy of many programmers
and students alike. Jokes aside, spend some time testing. I know
it may be boring, but view it as you're just making the system
more robust and building confidence in parts of the system so
if you change them later, you can verify nothing breaks.


[^ref1]: I considered looking through all of my college notes
and making a book of every acronym I've ever seen in CS,
and then realized that I value my sanity. However, if someone
wants to do this, let me know.

[^ref2]: Based on a true, incredibly embarrassing story. Don't ask.
